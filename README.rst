APSW stands for Another Python SQLite Wrapper.

About
=====

APSW is a Python wrapper for the `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/>`__
embedded relational database engine.  It focuses on being a minimal
layer over SQLite attempting to translate the complete SQLite C API
into Python.  It is recommended to use the builtin `sqlite3 module
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>`__, unless you want
SQLite specific functionality. The `documentation
<https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/pysqlite.html>`__ has a section on
the differences between APSW and sqlite3.  APSW supports CPython 3.7
onwards:

  A `release
  <https://www.rogerbinns.com/blog/apsw-ending-python2early3.html>`__
  from January 2022 supports all CPython versions back to 2.3.  The
  `tips <https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/tips.html>`__ include more
  information about versions.
