APSW stands for **A**\ nother **P**\ ython **S**\ QLite **W**\ rapper.   APSW
supports CPython 3.6 onwards.

About
=====

APSW is a Python wrapper for the `SQLite <https://sqlite.org/>`__
embedded relational database engine.  It focuses translating between
the complete `SQLite C API <https://sqlite.org/c3ref/intro.html>`__
and `Python's C API <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html>`__,
letting you get the most out of SQLite from Python.

It is recommended to use the builtin `sqlite3 module
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>`__ if you want SQLite
to be interchangeable with the other database drivers.

Use APSW when you want to use SQLite fully, and have an improved
developer experience.  The `documentation
<https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/pysqlite.html>`__ has a section on
the differences between APSW and sqlite3.
