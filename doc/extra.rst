SQLite extra
============

In addition to the main library, SQLite has additional programs and
loadable extensions.  However these need to be separately compiled and
installed.  Full APSW builds such as those on PyPI include all the
ones that compile for that platform.  This is for convenience and to
help promote these great extras.  They add just over 1MB to the
download and 3MB of disk space.

Access is provided via an :ref:`API <extra_api>` and via the
:ref:`command line <extra_api>`.

Dependencies
------------

There are no dependencies for the extensions and programs.  That means
they can be used on other compatible systems.  Some of the programs
require the SQLite library which **must** be placed in the same
directory as the program.

Marking
-------

The extensions and programs are all marked as packaged by APSW.  Under
Windows this is indicated in the detailed properties listing.  On
other platforms running :code:`strings` should show it, with ELF
binaries having a :code:`note.apsw` section and MacOS (Mach-O)
binaries having a :code:`apsw` section.

The marking includes the version details.

Command line
------------

Programs can be run by giving their name and parameters. For example
code:`sqlite3_scrub` ::

    python3 -m apsw.sqlite_extra sqlite3_scrub source.db dest.db

You can also get the filename for any program or extension.  For example the
:code:`sqlite3_rsync` program::

    python3 -m apsw.sqlite_extra --path sqlite3_rsync

The :code:`csv` extension::

    python3 -m apsw.sqlite_extra --path csv

List what is available::

    python3 -m apsw.sqlite_extra --list
