# Note: this code uses Python's optional typing annotations.  You can
# ignore them and do not need to use them
from typing import Optional, Iterator, Tuple

### version_check: Checking APSW and SQLite versions

# Where the extension module is on the filesystem
print("      Using APSW file", apsw.__file__)

# From the extension
print("         APSW version", apsw.apswversion())

# From the sqlite header file at APSW compile time
print("SQLite header version", apsw.SQLITE_VERSION_NUMBER)

# The SQLite code running
print("   SQLite lib version", apsw.sqlitelibversion())

# If True then SQLite is incorporated into the extension.
# If False then a shared library is being used, or static linking
print("   Using amalgamation", apsw.using_amalgamation)

### logging: Logging
# It is a good idea to get SQLite's logs as you will get more
# information about errors.  This has to be done first (a SQLite
# limitation, not APSW). :meth:`apsw.ext.log_sqlite` forwards
# SQLite's log messages to the :mod:`logging` module.

apsw.ext.log_sqlite()

# You can also write to SQLite's log
apsw.log(apsw.SQLITE_ERROR, "A message from Python")

### open_db:  Opening the database
# You open the database by using :class:`Connection`

# Default will create the database if it doesn't exist
connection = apsw.Connection("dbfile")

# Open existing read-only
connection = apsw.Connection("dbfile", flags=apsw.SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY)

# Open existing read-write (exception if it doesn't exist)
connection = apsw.Connection("dbfile", flags=apsw.SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE)

### executing_sql: Executing SQL
# Use :meth:`Connection.execute` to execute SQL

connection.execute("create table point(x,y,z)")
connection.execute("insert into point values(1, 2, 3)")
# You can use multiple ; separated statements
connection.execute("""
    insert into point values(4, 5, 6);
    create table log(timestamp, event);
    create table foo(a, b, c);
    create table important(secret, data);
""")

# read rows
for row in connection.execute("select * from point"):
    print(row)

### why_bindings: Why you use bindings to provide values
# It is tempting to compose strings with the values in them, but it is
# easy to mangle the query especially if values contain punctuation
# and unicode.  It is known as `SQL injection
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection>`__. Bindings are the
# correct way to supply values to queries.

# a simple value
event = "system started"
# DO NOT DO THIS
query = "insert into log values(0, '" + event + "')"
print("query:", query)

# BECAUSE ... a bad guy could provide a value like this
event = "bad guy here') ; drop table important; -- "
# which has effects like this
query = "insert into log values(0, '" + event + "')"
print("bad guy:", query)

### bindings_sequence: Bindings (sequence)
# Bindings can be provided as a sequence such as with
# a tuple or list.  Use **?** to show where the values go.

query = "insert into log values(?, ?)"
data = (7, "restart")
connection.execute(query, data)

# You can also use numbers after the ? to select
# values from the sequence.  Note that numbering
# starts at 1
query = "select ?1, ?3, ?2"
data = ("alpha", "beta", "gamma")
for row in connection.execute(query, data):
    print(row)

### bindings_dict: Bindings (dict)
# You can also supply bindings with a dictionary.  Use **:NAME**,
# **@NAME**, or **$NAME**, to provide the key name in the query.
# Names are case sensitive.

query = "insert into point values(:x, @Y, $z)"
data = {"x": 7, "Y": 8, "z": 9}
connection.execute(query, data)

### types: Using different types
# SQLite supports None, int, float, str, bytes (binary data). If a
# table declaration gives a type then SQLite attempts conversion.
# `Read more <https://www.sqlite.org/flextypegood.html>`__.

connection.execute("""
    create table types1(a, b, c, d, e);
    create table types2(a INTEGER, b REAL, c TEXT, d, e BLOB);
    """)

data = ("12", 3, 4, 5.5, b"\x03\x72\xf4\x00\x9e")
connection.execute("insert into types1 values(?,?,?,?,?)", data)
connection.execute("insert into types2 values(?,?,?,?,?)", data)

for row in connection.execute("select * from types1"):
    print("types1", repr(row))

for row in connection.execute("select * from types2"):
    print("types2", repr(row))

### transaction: Transactions
# By default each statement is its own transaction (3 in the
# example below).  A transaction finishes by flushing data to
# storage and waiting for the operating system to confirm it is
# permanently there (ie will survive a power failure) which takes
# a while.

connection.execute("insert into point values(2, 2, 2)")
connection.execute("insert into point values(3, 3, 3)")
connection.execute("insert into point values(4, 4, 4)")

# You can use BEGIN / END to manually make a transaction
connection.execute("BEGIN")
connection.execute("insert into point values(2, 2, 2)")
connection.execute("insert into point values(3, 3, 3)")
connection.execute("insert into point values(4, 4, 4)")
connection.execute("END")

# Or use `with`` that does it automatically
with connection:
    connection.execute("insert into point values(2, 2, 2)")
    connection.execute("insert into point values(3, 3, 3)")
    connection.execute("insert into point values(4, 4, 4)")

# Nested transactions are supported
with connection:
    connection.execute("insert into point values(2, 2, 2)")
    with connection:
        connection.execute("insert into point values(3, 3, 3)")
        connection.execute("insert into point values(4, 4, 4)")

### executemany: executemany
# You can execute the same SQL against a sequence using
# :meth:`Connection.executemany`

data = (
    (1, 1, 1),
    (2, 2, 2),
    (3, 3, 3),
    (4, 4, 4),
    (5, 5, 5),
)
query = "insert into point values(?,?,?)"

# we do it in a transaction
with connection:
    # the query is run for each item in data
    connection.executemany(query, data)

### exectrace: Tracing execution
# You can trace execution of SQL statements.  See :ref:`more about
# tracing <tracing>`.


def my_tracer(cursor: apsw.Cursor, statement: str, bindings: Optional[apsw.Bindings]) -> bool:
    "Called just before executing each statement"

        """, (3, ))

# if set on a connection then all cursors are traced
connection.exectrace = my_tracer
# and clearing it
connection.exectrace = None

### rowtrace: Tracing returned rows
# You can trace returned rows, including modifying what is returned or
# skipping it completely.  See :ref:`more about tracing <tracing>`.


def row_tracer(cursor: apsw.Cursor, row: apsw.SQLiteValues) -> apsw.SQLiteValues:
    """Called with each row of results before they are handed off.  You can return None to
    cause the row to be skipped or a different set of values to return"""

for row in cursor.execute("select x,y from point where x>4"):
    pass

# if set on a connection then all cursors are traced
connection.rowtrace = row_tracer
# and clearing it
connection.rowtrace = None

### scalar: Defining your own functions
# Scalar functions take one or more values and return one value.  They
# are registered by calling :meth:`Connection.createscalarfunction`.


def ilove7(*args: apsw.SQLiteValue) -> int:
    "A scalar function"
    print(f"ilove7 got { args } but I love 7")
    return 7


connection.createscalarfunction("seven", ilove7)

for row in connection.execute("select seven(x,y) from point where x>4"):
    print("row", row)

### aggregate: Defining aggregate functions
# Aggregate functions are called multiple times with matching rows,
# and then provide a final value.  An example is calculating an
# average.  They are registered by calling
# :meth:`Connection.createaggregatefunction`.


class longest:
    # Find which value when represented as a string is
    # the longest

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.longest = ""

        return cls(), cls.step, cls.final


connection.createaggregatefunction("longest", longest.factory)
for row in connection.execute("select longest(event) from log"):
    print(row)

### window: Defining window functions
# Window functions input values come from a "window" around a row of
# interest.  Four methods are called to add, remove, get the current
# value, and finalize as the window moves.
#
# An example is calculating an average of values in the window to
# compare to the row.  They are registered by calling
# :meth:`Connection.create_window_function`.
#
# This is the Python equivalent to the C based example in the `SQLite
# documentation
# <https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html#user_defined_aggregate_window_functions>`__

### collation: Defining collations (sorting)
# How you sort can depend on the languages or values involved.  You

### vfs: VFS - Virtual File System
# VFS lets you control access to the filesystem from SQLite.  APSW
# makes it easy to "inherit" from an existing VFS and monitor or alter
# data as it flows through.  Read more about :ref:`VFS <vfs>`.

# This example VFS "obfuscates" the database file contents by xor all
# bytes with 0xa5.  URI parameters are also shown as a way you can
# pass additional information for files.

### backup: Backup an open database
# You can backup a database that is open.  The pages are copied in
# batches of your choosing and allow continued use of the database.
# :ref:`Read more <backup>`.

# We will copy a disk database into a memory database

### shell: Shell
# APSW includes a :ref:`shell <shell>`  like the one in `SQLite
# <https://sqlite.org/cli.html>`__, and is also extensible from
# Python.

# Here we use the shell to do a csv export and then dump part of the
# database

# Export to a StringIO
import io

output = io.StringIO()
shell = apsw.shell.Shell(stdout=output, db=connection)

# How to execute a dot command
shell.process_command(".mode csv")
shell.process_command(".headers on")

# How to execute SQL
shell.process_sql("""
    create table csvtest(column1, column2 INTEGER);
    create index faster on csvtest(column1);
    insert into csvtest values(3, 4);
    insert into csvtest values('a b', NULL);
""")

# Or let the shell figure out SQL vs dot command
shell.process_complete_line("select * from csvtest")

# see the result
print(output.getvalue())

# reset output
output.seek(0)

# make a dump of the same table
shell.process_command(".dump csvtest%")

# see the result
print("\nDump output\n")
print(output.getvalue())

### status: Statistics
# SQLite provides statistics by :meth:`status`

current_usage, max_usage = apsw.status(apsw.SQLITE_STATUS_MEMORY_USED)

# This shows using :meth:`Connection.trace_v2`

# From https://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html
# Outlandish Recursive Query Examples

### cleanup:  Cleanup
# As a general rule you do not need to do any cleanup.  Standard
# Python garbage collection will take of everything.  Even if the
# process crashes with a connection in the middle of a transaction,
# the next time SQLite opens that database it will automatically
# rollback the partial data.

# You close connections manually (useful if you want to catch exceptions)
connection.close()
#  You can call close multiple times, and also indicate to ignore exceptions
connection.close(True)

# Deleting the database file. Note that there can be additional files
# with suffixes like -wal, -shm, and -journal.
os.remove("dbfile")
